## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Though it is has a scope of implementing elements in JS, I tried to implement the same in CSS and I am proud of the same. I have used CSS Grid extensively throughout the page and have used flexbox occasionally. Learnt the following things

- Maintaining BEM architecture
- Utility classes like margin-bottom, special-color
- Implemented with SASS preprocessor
- In the navigation achieved mobile hamburger option without JS , by implementing a checkbox on the hamburger menu and on click of it displaying the menu as given in the design.
- Have considered four breakpoints, at 1440px(large desktop), 1200px(laptop), 900px(tablet) and 375px(phone).
- Have implemented cubic beizer animation functionality for displaying the menu.
- For the link in the features section, have used the utility class to change the colour of the border since I have reused the code for DRY principle.
- Throughout the features section, have followed DRY principle by not repeating the code.
- Wherever necessary have used picture tag for the browser to use the mobile version of the image for the breakpoints below 900px.
